# pokemon-pairs

This game was made for [coding challenge 14](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/coding_challenge-14).

The challenge was to create a matching game with vanilla javascript that has the following features:
- Time elapsed until you complete the game (all cards revealed)
- Total Moves count before you complete the game
- Reset button to start the game over

Known Issues:
- Quickly clicking multiple cards can lead to cards not flipping back; to fix this the player will need to either restart the game or click the matching card which will flip them both back over. The game can then be completed but the timer will continue counting until a restart.
